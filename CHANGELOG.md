## Changelog
### Version 1.6 [CURRENT VERSION] (4/20/2019)
- Added
  - Texture Set support, data will display in the Text Viewer
  - "Multifile Entry" support, any entry that contains additional files (Build Table, LOD Selector, to name a couple)
    - **found by right-clicking an entry or subentry and selecting `Multifile Entry > Extract Contained Files`, which reveals the Multifile Entry Exporter**
  - `Tools > Show File in the Viewers` and `Tools > Export 3D Viewer Contents`; both features are self-explanatory
  - number of results displays in the Find window
  - `Filter By` in the Find window (easily locate 3D models and textures)
  - automatic normal map fixing feature (flips blue channel; credit to @cire992), can be turned off in the Settings
  - 500+ new Resource Identifiers

  -- **note: extraction may take slightly longer as a result**

- Fixed
  - a temporary file path will be created and set if the user did not set one

  - OBJ exporter; now you can import models into your preferred software without errors, though UVs do not always come out properly
  - the Resource Identifiers Viewer would not open if the user right-clicked on a subentry/Resource Identifier
  - the Image Viewer would show its previous image by changing to zoom level if a different (3D or text) asset was loaded
  - a crash caused by opening a GlobalMetaFile from Steep
  - various issues

- Added

  - better Origins 3D model support
  - 3D Viewer displays models 5x larger
