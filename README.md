# Blacksmith
A program for viewing, extracting, and converting (textures, 3D models, and sounds) from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, Assassin's Creed: Origins, and Steep. It is in early stages, and this repo will be updated constantly with additional support.

> **Note**: Blacksmith is NOT a repacker.

>> **Another note**: Blacksmith supports ALL VERSIONS (past, latest, and future versions) of each game

>>> **Last note**: Blacksmith *DOES NOT CONDONE PIRACY*. The program assumes that you have access to the games' files.

# Update regarding the repo
I will no longer be updating the repo with the source code of 1.7 and later. This is now a donation perk. I have migrated away from GitHub due to the amount of effort and time I have put into development. Sorry guys.

However, the changelog and Releases page will still be updated. The repo will stay online and will not be deleted.

### Remember ARchive_neXt?
Blacksmith tries to serve as a successor to ARchive_neXt, since development has seemingly ceased, and it does not support the two latest Assassin's Creed games or Steep. I designed the functionality of Blacksmith to be identical to that of ARchive_neXt.
